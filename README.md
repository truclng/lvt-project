Situation
Meyd.it is a digital, double-sided marketplace that connects consumers looking for tailor-made
clothes from makers who often independently work from home and not necessarily full-time.
Thousands of skilled tailors and designers in Sydney alone are willing to take on gig-based
work.
Consumers (may also be called buyers or clients) can register for an account for free, create a
“job” along with inspirations, publish the job (or may also be called “making”), get quotations,
accept quotations, make payments upfront for the entire project, acknowledge receipt of goods,
and provide feedback on the markers or the outcome of their makings.
The Markers can create an account for free, update their Ateliers, find and bid for jobs, update
the accepted job status, and provide delivery details for shipped items.
The business, Meydit, would take 15% of the total cost of the job.
